Pour in the ice cold water, little at a time, mixing with a fork. Finish by hand and shape into a ball.',

          '3- Once the dough is chilled, divide it into 2 pieces, one about twice as large as the other. The larger piece will be the bottom crust, the smaller one the top crust. Roll the larger piece of dough into a 13-inch (33 cm) circle and transfer it into the prepared pan. Trim the edges so that they overlap the rim of the pan all the way around.',

Check the pie after 20 minutes of baking and cover the edges with foil to keep them from burning too quickly. When the pie is ready, remove it from the oven and let cool completely before slicing. Serve with some vanilla ice cream and enjoy!',

          '3- Using a rolling pin as a guide, place over a 9×2-inch (23×5 cm) deep dish cake pan or cast-iron skillet. Using your fingers, press the dough into the cake pan. Make sure it is nice and tight fitting inside the pan. Trim any excess of dough off the edges with a small knife. Brush the top edges of the dough with a little olive oil, which gives the crust a beautiful sheen.',
